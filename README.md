# SmarterCameraII

SmarterCameraII is an iOS/macOS application designed to provide advanced camera features and smart image processing capabilities. This project is organized following a scalable Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, making it easy to extend and maintain.

## Features

- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:
  - **Controllers**: Manage user interactions and coordinate between views and application logic.
  - **Logic**: Contains the core functionality and algorithms for smart camera features.
  - **Views**: UI components for displaying camera previews and related controls.
- Standard Xcode project structure.
- Easily extensible for new camera features or UI updates.
